        <p> <span style="color: rgb(225, 173, 18);" >Nerdy Nummies</span> is a Youtube channel I loved to watch when I was a kid. My mom loves to bake,
            so I'd always search up recipes and how-to videos of pastries and baked goods I wanted to make.This rainbow cake video 
            is a tutorial I remember watching back over and over again, because the cake looked so yummy and vibrant. I also really enjoyed the quirkiness of the Youtuber, <span style="color:  rgb(225, 173, 18);" >Rosanna Pansino</span>
            and how she really made me feel like everything she made was easy to bake and something I could make too! I never got around to following any of her actual recipes 
            but I loved her videos!
